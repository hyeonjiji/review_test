      <pre style="font-family: 'Pretendard'; line-height: 2;">
    Since I met you I've been crazy
    Since I've been with you I've been lost
    You make everything seem so hazy
    Love comes with such a cost
    Have I lost my mind?
    Have I lost my mind?
    Have I lost my mind?
    Follow me down to the river
    Drink while the water is clean
    Follow me down to the river tonight
    I'll be down here on my knees
    So follow me down to the river
    Follow me down through the trees
    Follow me down to the river, man
    I'll be down here on my knees
    I'll be down here on my knees
    Nights avoiding things unholy
    Your hand slips across my skin
    I go down on you so slowly
    Don't confess none of your sins
    Have I lost my mind?
    Have I lost my mind?
    Follow me down to the river
    Drink while the water is clean
    Follow me down to the river tonight
    I'll be down here on my knees
    So follow me down to the river
    Follow me down through the trees
    Follow me down to the river, man
    I'll be down here on my knees
    I'll be down here on my knees
    When you're young you always take what you can get
    Even bicycles and sprinklers get you wet
    Now I know that there's a different way to die
    My body breathes
    Heart still beats
    But I am not alive
    Follow me down to the river
    Drink while the water is clean
    Follow me down to the river tonight
    I'll be down here on my knees
    So follow me down to the river
    Follow me down through the trees
    Follow me down to the river, man
    I'll be down here on my knees
    I'll be down here on my knees
    Young love as sweet as can be.</pre
